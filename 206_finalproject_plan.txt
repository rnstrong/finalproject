Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?

2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
a class Movie


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
The class will take a dictionary that represents the movie that will be retrieved from the OMDB api.


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
One instance of the class will represent one movie.


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
3 instance variables might be, title--which will hold the title of the film to be shown the the user later in the results and database, the IMDB_id which will be used as the primary key in the table later on, and the director_name which will be used to look up data on Twitter.


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
num_languages

- What will the method do?
This method will retrieve the list of languages the movie is in and compute the length of the list

- Will it take any additional input? 
No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return the number of languages the movie is in.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It will be useful to see how popular a movie is by how many languages it has been translated into in the results.


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
get_director

- What will the method do?
This method will return the name of the director for the given instance

- Will it take any additional input? 
No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

It will return the name of the director for the given instance
- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
It will be used when I submit information to twitter to search for the director's name

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
Tweets, Users, and Movies


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text 
- tweet_id (primary key)
- user_id
- imdb_id 
- num_favorites
- num_retweets

Users:
- User_id (primary key)
- screen_name
- num_favorites
- followers_count 

Movies:
- imdb_id (primary key)
- title
- director
- num_languages
- IMDB rating
- first_actor






* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

1) I want to make a query that accesses the title and director for a movie given that the followers_count of the director is greater than 100K -- so I'll be joining the movies and users tables.
2) I want to make a query that returns title, num_languages, director, and followers_count so I'll be joining all three tables


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

List comprehension -- I think I'm going to use list comprehension when creating a list of tuples representing movies ordered by "popularity" (a combination of director popularity and IMDB rating)

Zip -- I will probably use the zip function to help me create said lists of tuples



* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

I will be outputting to a txt file and it will contain a summary of the popularity of the movies searched, given the director's popularity, the IMDB rating, and the number of languages it has been translated into.
